    //But the question is Why are we doing the parent class abstract
    //then we can also use normal method overriding?
    //simple answer it looks more clean in the parent class

        Daughter daughter = new Daughter(28);
        daughter.career();

        // we can do this also reference type is is of parent but at the runtime the object is getting created of the Daughter
        // so we can access all the Daughter class this is runtime polymorphism same thing we did it in the inheritance
        //ditto copy paste.

        Parent daughter2 = new Daughter(30);
        daughter2.career();

        //Now will create the object for parent
        // Parent mom = new Parent();
        //this is above parent object will give error as we cannot create the object of abstract class
        // in order to do so we need the override its methods
        //look below example
//        Parent dad = new Parent(56) {
//            @Override
//            void career() {
//
//            }
//
//            @Override
//            void partner() {
//
//            }
//        };
