package com.atik.abstractDemo;

public abstract class Parent {
    //Q : can we have variables in the abstract class?
    //A : Sure we can ,check the example below

    int age;
    final int VALUE;


    //Q : can we Create an constructor of abstract Class?
    //A : lets try

    public Parent(int age){
        this.age=age;
        VALUE=23456;  // so this final int value cannot be access ,hence we cannot access it without creating the object
                      // but we can call it through the super();
    }

    //Q : Can we Create abstract constructors
    //A : no we cant create see below it wil give error? line 18
    //abstract  Parent();

    //Q: Why cant we create the object of abstract class?
    //A :no, Because if you try to create the object of the parent class
    //    and we try to call the method for eg career()  ones it will give
    //    java be like hey you are calling this method but id does not have any body how can i call it?
    //  Similarly ,we cannot create abstract constructors.

    //Q : can we create abstract static methods?
    //A : No,Why ? because methods are override and  statics are not meant to be overridden
    //   Do static methods get overriden ? no then what is the point of making static abstract methods?

    //Q : but can you create the static methods in the abstract classes?
    //A : Yes, that we can do,look below

    //Q : Can we have normal methods?
    //A  : Yes we can look below example

    //Q : Can we use the final keyword with abstract the class
    //A : No,Why because final restricts the inheritance so common sense we want the abstract class to be inherited

    void normal(){
        System.out.println("i am normal method");
    }

    static void hello(){
        System.out.println("Hey");
    }

    abstract void career();
    abstract void partner();
}
