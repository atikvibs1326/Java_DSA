This is program has the 
time complexity of = O(N²) which is very bad 

beacause for every iteration it is creating a new object
like first it is empty string 
      " "+a =a
      "a"+b =ab
      "ab"+c=abc
      "abc"+d= abcd
      ......
      "abc..xy"+z="abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
      
      So the objects which are created above the last iterations are defrenced that means they are not pointing to anything so
      this leads to extra space and extraspace result into O(N²) which is very bad.
      
      How to do it in another way?
      how we can optimize it ?
      How good it could be if there was a such kind of datatype or whatever that could use only one object and just make change to it like we do in the arrays 
      for that we use String Builder?
      You can check StringBuilder in the Sbuilder.java
